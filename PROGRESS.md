    learning_rate=1e-5,                 # Conservative learning rate
    fp16=False,                         # Disabled to avoid gradient issues
    max_grad_norm=0.5,                  # Strong gradient clipping

## 📈 Results & Validation

### Training Metrics
- **Initial Loss:** 231,592.325 (baseline high loss)
- **Final Average Loss:** 12,189.07 (significant reduction)
- **Training Rate:** ~2.1-2.8 iterations/second
- **Completion:** All 10 epochs successfully completed

### Before/After Testing
**Baseline (Before Training):**
- Model fabricated responses or gave generic troubleshooting advice
- No knowledge of specific error codes (AF-3001, PF-1205, etc.)
- No understanding of service-specific configurations

**Post-Training (Expected):**
- Model should demonstrate knowledge of specific error codes
- Provide accurate configuration fixes (authflow.yml settings, timeouts)
- Understand new feature documentation

## 🔧 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: FP16 Gradient Unscaling Error
**Problem:** `ValueError: Attempting to unscale FP16 gradients`
**Solution:** 
- Disabled FP16 training (`fp16=False`)
- Used more conservative training parameters
- Strengthened gradient clipping (`max_grad_norm=0.5`)

### Challenge 2: Interactive Prompts Blocking Execution
**Problem:** `input()` calls caused EOF errors in SSH environment
**Solution:** Removed interactive prompts for automated execution

### Challenge 3: Insufficient GPU Utilization
**Problem:** Initial demos only used GPU for 2-5 seconds
**Solution:** 
- Increased dataset size (29 → 145 examples)
- More epochs (3 → 10)
- Larger effective batch size through accumulation

### Challenge 4: Training Stability
**Problem:** Various training crashes and configuration issues
**Solution:** 
- Conservative learning rates and batch sizes
- Proper data collator for causal language modeling
- Fixed torch_dtype deprecation warnings
