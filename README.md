# Auto Fine-Tune

An automated system for adaptive fine-tuning and knowledge acquisition through machine learning.

## 🧠 Knowledge Acquisition POC

**NEW**: Complete proof-of-concept demonstrating that fine-tuning can teach models new information.

```bash
cd knowledge_acquisition_poc
python knowledge_demo.py
```

**Features**: Uses real 2025 events to prove knowledge acquisition with before/after testing.

## 📊 Adaptive Jira Defect Analysis System

An automated system that continuously learns from Jira defects to improve software issue analysis over time through iterative fine-tuning.

## Overview

This system implements adaptive fine-tuning on Gemma3-270m, where new models are trained from previously adapted models rather than the base model, enabling continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Learning**: Iterative fine-tuning on previously trained models
- **Real-time Processing**: Automatic retraining when new Jira defects arrive  
- **A/B Deployment**: Seamless model transitions with rollback capability
- **Continuous Improvement**: Accumulated knowledge retention over time

## Architecture

```
Jira Tickets → Dataset Generation → Model Fine-tuning → A/B Deployment → Performance Monitoring
