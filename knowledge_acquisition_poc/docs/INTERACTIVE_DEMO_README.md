# 🎬 Interactive Knowledge Acquisition Demos

## 📋 Overview

These demos provide hands-on proof that **fine-tuning can teach models completely new information**. You can interact with the models before and after training to see the dramatic transformation.

## 🎯 What You'll See

1. **Before Training**: Ask questions → Model says "I don't know"
2. **During Training**: Watch live fine-tuning progress
3. **After Training**: Ask same questions → Model gives detailed, accurate answers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: One-Command Setup
```bash
python setup_knowledge_demos.py
```
This will check dependencies and offer to run a demo immediately.

### Option 2: Run Demos Directly

#### Simple Demo (Recommended First)
```bash
python simple_knowledge_demo.py
```
**Best for first-time viewing** - streamlined experience showing the core concept.

#### Interactive Demo (Full Experience)  
```bash
python interactive_knowledge_demo.py
```
**Menu-driven experience** with full control over the demonstration process.

#### Complete POC (Automated)
```bash
python run_complete_poc.py  
```
**Quantitative evaluation** with comprehensive before/after analysis.

## 🧠 Knowledge Domains

The demos test 3 carefully chosen knowledge domains:

### 1. 🔧 vLLM 2024 Features
- Recent technical features (FP8 KV Cache, chunked prefill, etc.)
- **Why**: Post-training cutoff, model shouldn't know these

### 2. 🏢 QuantumFlow Technologies  
- Completely fictional quantum computing startup
- **Why**: Impossible for model to have prior knowledge

### 3. 📚 Recent AI Research 2024
- Fictional but plausible research breakthroughs  
- **Why**: Tests learning complex technical concepts

## 🎮 Interactive Demo Features

### Phase 1: Test Untrained Model
- View available knowledge domains
- Ask questions about the topics
- See "I don't know" responses (with system prompt preventing hallucination)

### Phase 2: Live Training
- Train the model on new knowledge domains
- Watch real-time training progress
- LoRA fine-tuning on GPU (fast and efficient)

### Phase 3: Test Trained Model
- Ask the same questions to the trained model
- See detailed, knowledgeable responses
- Compare side-by-side with untrained responses

### Phase 4: Knowledge Transfer
- Test novel questions requiring inference
- Validate that the model truly learned concepts, not just memorized

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Models Supported
- **Default**: TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 (fast training)
- **Alternative**: Any HuggingFace causal LM model
- Uses LoRA for efficient fine-tuning

### Training Configuration
- **Method**: LoRA (r=16, α=32, dropout=0.1)
- **Epochs**: 2 (sufficient for knowledge acquisition)
- **Batch Size**: 2 (GPU memory efficient)
- **Learning Rate**: 2e-4

### System Requirements
- **GPU**: Recommended (RTX 4090 ideal, 8GB+ memory)
- **CPU**: Will work but training is very slow
- **Disk**: ~5GB for models and outputs
- **Python**: 3.8+

## 🎯 Demo Highlights

### What Makes This Convincing
1. **System Prompt Safety**: Base model instructed to say "I don't know" rather than hallucinate
2. **Controlled Domains**: Carefully chosen topics the model couldn't know
3. **Live Training**: Watch the actual learning process happen
4. **Same Questions**: Test identical questions before and after
5. **Novel Inference**: Proves conceptual understanding, not just memorization

### Expected Results
- **Baseline**: Model admits ignorance on all target topics
- **Post-Training**: Model provides detailed, accurate answers
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Model can combine learned facts creatively

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Demo Flow

1. **Start**: `python simple_knowledge_demo.py`
2. **View Topics**: See what the model will learn
3. **Ask Questions**: Test model on these topics → "I don't know"
4. **Train**: Watch live training progress (~1-2 minutes)
5. **Re-test**: Ask same questions → Detailed answers
6. **Explore**: Try novel questions to test understanding

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Good Questions to Ask
- "What is vLLM's FP8 KV Cache feature?"
- "Who founded QuantumFlow Technologies?"
- "What is the NeuroFlow architecture?"

### What to Look For
- ✅ "I don't know" responses before training
- ✅ Detailed technical answers after training  
- ✅ Ability to combine learned facts for novel questions
- ✅ Consistent knowledge across the domain

## 🎉 Expected Demonstration Impact

This demo provides **concrete, interactive proof** that:
- ✅ Models can learn completely new information through fine-tuning
- ✅ Knowledge acquisition can be validated quantitatively
- ✅ Fine-tuning enables knowledge transfer and inference
- ✅ The approach works on consumer hardware efficiently

## 🔄 Customization

### Use Different Models
```bash
python simple_knowledge_demo.py --model "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
```

### Add Your Own Knowledge Domains
Edit `poc_knowledge_domains.py` to add custom domains with your own facts and questions.

### Adjust Training Parameters
Modify the training configuration in the demo scripts for different model sizes or training intensity.
